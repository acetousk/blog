### Windows
- Instal [Git SCM](https://git-scm.com/downloads). This is a CLI (command line interface) for using [Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-git). 
- After you download and install Git SCM then run the `Git Bash` application. A [terminal](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/command-line-cheat-sheet/) should appear.
- Now get familiar with these commands:

Clone your repo from github:
```git clone https://github.com/username/exampleRepo```

Change the current working directory(or folder) to `exampleRepo`. 
```cd ~/exampleRepo"```

To add new files to your repo:
```git add -A```

 - `-A` will check all of the new files and add them to the repo

To do a commit:
```git commit -a -m "working code: nov 3" ```
- `-a` adds everything that you have done. 
 - `-m` includes a message that is what the commit is 
named in the form of a `"String"`.
 -  The `"String"` is what the commit is named

To push your code(after committing) to github:
```git push```

To pull your code from github:
```git pull```
