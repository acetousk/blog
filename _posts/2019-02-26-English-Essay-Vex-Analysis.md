Vex Robotics is an educational robotics program. They give you resources to create a robot. This includes: metal, nuts and bolts, gears, motors, microcontroller, etc. When you put all of these things together, you get a robot.

The purpose of vex robotics is to teach through a game. Each year there is a different "game." This year's "game" is called "Turning Point." You compete in a 12 by 12 foot field. The match is set up with an even amount of toggled game elements. Each match starts with a 15 second autonomous period. At the end of this 15 seconds, the alliance with the most points wins an extra four points. Then, the driver control period starts. During this time the drivers control the robot with their controller and try to score as many points as possible. At the end, whoever has the most points (including the autonomous bonus) wins the match.

There are two red alliance robots and two blue alliance robots. Like most other sports, the team with the most points wins. You get points by: shooting balls at flags, shoving the bottom flag, flipping caps, stacking caps, and parking. A toggled high flag(facing your alliance color) gets you two points. The low flag(facing your color) is worth one point. A flipped cap(with your alliance color facing up) gets one point. A stacked cap (facing your color) gets you two points. Parking on your alliance platform gets you three points and parking on the center platform gets you six points.

After that, it is what people call a "round robin" or a tournament. Teams choose another team to compete with for the rest of the day. It starts with the first seat and goes down until there are 8 or 16 teams that compete. They then compete in a bracket and the winning alliance wins the tournament champion award.

The most popular awards that you can win are:

- Excellence Award (This is the Highest Award Vex Robotics Gives. You performed the best and the judges like you the most.)

- Design Award (This is a well performing team that has a really good robot. Kind of like 2nd place in judges)

- Judges Award (This team has a really good robot but under-performed or the judge just really likes the robot.)

- Tournament Champion (They won the finals in the Elimination Bracket.)

- Tournament Finalist (The got to the finals in the Elimination Bracket.)

Robotics competions are the best part of robotics. At a robotics comp(/tournament), it starts out with a series of matches. Everyone plays against each other. Depending on whether a given team wins or loses, the teams will be ranked from first to last at the end of the "Season".

The current "meta" is what we, at Skyridge, call a "ball" bot. They are able to shoot balls and flip caps, but are really good at doing one thing.
  

![Our Robot Shooting Balls](https://i.imgur.com/ernpPMS.png)

You intake the balls with rubber bands on sprockets. The ball goes up through a series of intake rollers or advanced tank tread.

However, you can have an intake roller that doubles as a cap flipper. You don't need to change anything to make this work. It's insane how well this works.

The launcher can be a variety of things. However, throughout the season most people use punchers. You have a motor attached to a slip gear. The gear pulls back a linear rail with rubber bands attached. When the slip gear slips, it forces the linear rail to hit the ball with enough force to send it flying.

These ball bots work because of the way the arena is made, and the fact that they are worth more points. All of the flags are put in a relatively small area. At the same time the posts for the caps are put far apart making them harder to toggle. It's easier to toggle them and they are worth more points. If all of the flags are toggled then, you get 15 points rather than the 14 points of the caps.

Another thing that makes ball bots work is that it will always take more time and engineering to put a cap on a post than to take it off. People also put videos on [youtube]() that intentionally discourage the use of cap bots.
